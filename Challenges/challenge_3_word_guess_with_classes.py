"""
Word guess refactored to use classes.

Some explanation:
__init__ is the default function that gets called when you instantiate
a new object, e.g. game = WordGame()

Classes have properties (e.g. answser) that can be accessed within the
class by calling self.property_name (e.g. self.answer).

Methods are functions that belong to an object (e.g. play_game) and are
run by calling self.method_name (e.g. self.play_game()).

In this case, user_did_win is a method that acts like a property
because it uses a property decorator (@property), so it can be accessed
by calling self.user_did_win, not self.user_did_win() <- no parentheses.
